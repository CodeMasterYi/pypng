Cython instructions are unclear (and I don't care much).

Why does __undo_filter_average etc "return 0"? (is it because
of Cython?)

The `fa` variable in filter_scanline is redundant. Just mutate
filter_type instead.

convert_la_to_rgba seems very slow; ditto convert_l_to_rgba; and
convert_rgb_to_rgba.

iBaseFilter isn't necessary. Or is it? It's used later for
16-bit images.

Need documentation for filter_type in class Writer.

"for idat in idat"! really!?

Comment starting "#Filtering" should be moved.

byteextend now applies filters. Rename appropriately.

The "Apply a scanline filter" comment seems to have gone.
replace it.

adapt_methods etc is badly commented.

adapt_sum and adapt_entropy inconsistent style. Also, can we
use min() with a key= argument (probably not in Python 2.2)

"return array('B', raw)" should be bytearray?

"typ != 'IDAT'" should not use a variable called "typ".

Why have iteridat() and iterdecomp been renamed?

"Note that order in list is not equal to filter number" yeah.
well, perhaps it should be.

in setup.py ...

Instead of setupt I'd prefer "setuptools = False; try: import
setuptools".

Similarly, cythonize = False.  Hmm cythonize.

from os.path import join. bletch.
from lib2to3.main import main. bletch bletch.

os.remove bare except: very very bad.
